# Selecting DOM elements in tests

When I searched the internet a while ago looking for the best way to reliably
select DOM elements in tests, all the advices I found were about how to deal
with existing applications, from a QA engineer point of view. But I was
interested what approach would be the best to start with, to implement as a
developer. That's the focus of this article.

## Approaches to selecting DOM elements

Let's explore what are the options.

### test-id and data-* attributes

A popular way to tag HTML elements for easier and more reliable selection in
tests is by adding a `test-id` attribute:

```
<div test-id="I am the div that you need"></div>
```

The HTML spec does not allow random attributes on DOM elements, and `test-id` is
not a standard attribute. We don't want to be arrested by the W3C police
department, so let's consider it a pass.

`data-*` attributes, for instance `data-test-id` or `data-cy`, are
conceptually no different from `test-id`, but HTML spec-compliant.

[Selectors spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-4/) lists a few the ways of
selecting DOM elements using HTML attributes, here's an example of using such
selectors in JavaScript:

```
# to find <div data-cy="foo">hi</div>
document.querySelector("[data-cy='foo']")

# to find <div test-id="barbecue">hi</div> or <div test-id="barbara">hi</div>
document.querySelector("[test-id^='bar']")
```

Nothing prevents us to use multiple `data-*` attributes, adding elaborate meta
information to the DOM elements.

One question, though: if we put an effort into exposing this much data into the
DOM, why not make it _accessible_ to the user?

### Exposing React component names manually

If frontenders think in components (i.e. React components), and often even test
not the whole application but individual components, why wouldn't they share
this mindset with QAs and expose the component names into the DOM?

The outer DOM elements of components might be given an attribute like
`data-component-name` or just `data-component`:

```
const MyComponent = ({name}) => (
  <div data-component="MyComponent">
    <div>Hello, {name}!</div>
  </div>
)
```

We tried this in a big project and it worked, but there's a downside: testing
code becomes tangled with the frontend code implementation details, which React
components are; refactoring components might break tests.

### Using React component names effortlessly

This is a twist on the previous idea.

If you have the React Developer Tools extension installed, you should be
familiar with the Components tab in the browser console. Think for a moment what
happens when you click the rectangle and cursor icon on the Components tab in
console: you select a DOM element on the page and see the corresponding component
in the tree of React components. So there's obviously a mapping between the two!

Webdriver.io pioneered with this approach, providing the
[API](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/browser/react$) that allows to find DOM
elements by React component names. It uses the
[resq](https://github.com/baruchvlz/resq) library under the hood, and anyone can
use that library even directly, without webdriver.io. Want to try? Here's how to
do it using vanilla JS:

1. Open any website that uses React. This website uses React, so you can just
stay on this page and proceed to the next step.

2. Open the browser console. Make sure you have React Developer Tools browser
extension installed. Once the extension is installed, you should see the
"Components" tab.

3. Import the `resq` library into the page as a global variable. In a real
project you might want to install the `resq` package from npm, but because `resq`
exports a UMD module, here's a fun way to inject it into any existing page. Paste
the following into the browser console and hit Enter:

```
const script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'text/javascript'
script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/resq@1.10.1/dist/index.js'
document.body.appendChild(script)
```

Now you've got `resq` object available (type `resq` and hit Enter in the
console, there should be no error). The `resq` API is described at
https://github.com/baruchvlz/resq.

4. In the browser console, open the Components tab, find and remember any
component name. If the code is minified, most of the component names will be one
or two letter words.

5.  Explore the DOM tree ("Elements" tab in the console in Chrome) and find the
root node of the application. If you don't have access to the source code it
takes a bit of a guess work, usually that's something like `<div id="app">`,
`<div id="root">`, `<div id="___gatsby">` or `<div id="__next">`.

```
// The React application's root node
const appRootNode = document.getElementById('__next')

// A component name from the Components tab
const componentName = 'Button' // replace with any actual name!

// Returns the DOM node
resq.resq$(componentName, appRootNode).node
```

Voil√† - we are able to select DOM elements by React component names even out of
a coplete soup of divs with zero effort from the frontenders.

There's a challange, though: most React apps go through code minification in the
build step, and what I found tricky was to minify the code while keeping the
component names _not_ minified. I tinkered with webpack settings, to no success.
Theoretically source maps should help, but the sourcemap support in `resq` is
[still pending](https://github.com/baruchvlz/resq/issues/17). Note that the
minified names change on every re-build, so it doesn't make sense to hardcode
those in tests.

This approach has the same downside as the previous approach - it's not
refactoring-friendly, and in addition it relies on React's internals which
theoretically can change any time with the version change of React.

### XPath selectors

While XPath is sometimes mentioned as a way to select DOM elements, it's just a
programming API which bears no additional semantics. And the point of this
article is to agree on semantics.

### Selecting via accessibility attributes

Consider a not-so-semantic piece of HTML, which thanks to some CSS and JS
visually appears as a familiar widget, for instance a range slider. Useful for a
person without disabilities, not so useful for a screen reader trying to
pronounce the contents of the page to a visually-impaired user.

A better way would be to use semantically appropriate HTML elements and `aria-*`
attributes, so not only we will not have to reinvent with `data-*` attributes
what's already been thought through with ARIA, but also to finally start paying
real attention to the accessibility of our web apps.

It's not that accessibility requires a lot of effort to implement, but it does
require an effort to figure it out - there's a learning curve for developers.
**Screen readers need the same hints to read the web page out loud that a
testing code needs**, and if application accessibility becomes crucial for
testing, developers can finally allocate some time to learn about accessibility
and simplyfy life of both testers and people with disabilities. A double win!

## Summary

We compared various approaches to selecting DOM elements in tests and concluded
that using accessibility attributes for selecting DOM elements could be the best
approach in many cases.
