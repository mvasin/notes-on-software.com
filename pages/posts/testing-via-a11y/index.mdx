# Testing via accessibility properties

In the [previous post](/posts/selecting-dom-elements-overview) I shared why
accessibility properties of DOM elements might be the best way to target
elements in tests. In this post let's see how can we practically do it.

## Accessiblity basics

Every DOM element has an "accessible name" and a "role", those are probably the
most important accessibility-related properties of a DOM element, let's briefly
review them.

### Accessible names

Simply put, the accessible name would be inferred from the text content of an
HTML element, or from an "alt" attribute if it's an image - there's a
[spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.2/) describing how the accessible name
should be calculated by a browser. `aria-label` attribute should be specified
only when there's a need to override the otherwise inferred accessible name.

### Roles

Roles are used to categorize elements of user interface. This means that knowing
the role, a screen reader would be able to explain to a blind user what kind of
a widget is in front of them. Be it an HTML element like `<input type="range">`
or, if we want to re-create the slider ourselves, a ridicilous soup of `div`s with
the `slider` role explicitly specified `<div aria-role="slider">...</div>`, in
both cases disabled users will be able to reason about and interact with in the
slider the same way.

Key takeaway of this section: prefer the semantically appropriate HTML elements
and do not specify `aria-*` attributes manually unless absolutely necessary;
semantic HTML markup already implies sane defaults. How do you know if it's
necessary or not? Check the "Accessibility" sub-tab of the "Elements" tab in
Chrome DevTools: "Computed Properties" section should contain meaningful
`Name` and `Role` properties.

## A quick accessibility lab

Let's do a quick lab to consolidate what we've just discussed.

Start with the following HTML document, intentionally using non-semantic HTML
elements. Save it as an HTML file and open in a browser.

```
<html>
  <body>
    <div style="border: 1px solid black; display: inline;">click me</div>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you're on a Mac, trying this page in a screen reader takes 2 seconds: click
the "Siri" button at the top right, ask Siri to turn on VoiceOver and
refresh the web page. You will hear VoiceOver saying "click me", giving no hint
that it's a button.

Let's improve the code by using the semantically suitable HTML element:

```
<html>
  <body>
    <input type="button" value="click me" />
  </body>
</html>
```

Now VoiceOver says "click me, button". Way better!

Here's how the "Accessibility" sub-tab of the "Elements" tab looks in Chrome:

<Image src={inputTypeButton} alt="default accessibility attributes of the input field" />

Notice `Role: button` and `Name: "click me"` are inferred in without us
specifying `aria-role` and `aria-label`.

If we replace `<input type="button" value="click me" />` with
`<button>click me</button>`, nothing changes in accessibility attributes, just
as nothing changes in the user experience.

Now we can even use an image in the button, and as long as `alt` attribute is
filled in, the same tests continue to pass:

<Image src={buttonLogoAlt} alt="accessibility attributes of a button with an image" />

Note on the screenshot that the Computed Properties accordion section gives us a
hint where the accessible name was inferred from (the `alt` attribute in this
case).

So accessibility attributes serve as a higher order abstraction, allowing
refactoring without breaking tests. Sweet!

## Using accessibility properties

Unfortunately, as of late 2021, there's no way to query the accessibility tree.
Accessibility Object Model specification which aims to enable that is still in
early draft.

We can't select with `document.querySelector("[aria-label='click me']")` if
`aria-label` was not explicitly specified, and it's important from both
productivity and correctness perspectives not to specify the accessibility
attributes explicitly unless absolutely needed.

But we know from the [ARIA spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1) which HTML
elements correspond to which roles, that's a 1:1 mapping. And the algorithm of
inferring accessible names which is described in the ["Accessible Name and
Description Computation" spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/) can also be
implemented. In fact, both are already realized in the [Testing
library](https://testing-library.com/). Until the Accessibility Object Model
describes the API to query DOM elements by computed accessibility properties and
the browsers implement it, I suggest using the Testing library.

## Summary

Accessibility attributes provide a nice higher order abstraction, which allows
refactoring the implementation while keeping the tests. Just note that there's no
standard API for querying DOM elements by their counterpart nodes in the
accessibility tree yet, but [Testing library](https://testing-library.com/) can
serve as a polyfill.

head around accessibility, use should allocate time to read the specs:
